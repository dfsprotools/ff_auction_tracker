The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a multi-user Fantasy Football Auction Tracker application into a streamlined, single-user commissioner mode. The initial task involved restoring a comprehensive codebase from a provided zip file, setting up the full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB environment, and ensuring core functionalities like league management, auction drafting, and player data were operational.

Subsequent phases focused on critical refinements: removing multi-user authentication, establishing a dual-screen setup with real-time synchronization between the Draft HQ () and Auction Tracker (), restoring and perfecting dynamic auction value calculations, completely eliminating Kicker positions from the entire application, adjusting default league settings to 3 starting WRs, adding a CSV export feature for draft results, and finally, resolving a persistent display flickering issue. The engineer meticulously addressed each user request, performed detailed debugging, and verified functionality with screenshots and console logs.

<product_requirements>
The user provided a zip file containing a pre-existing Fantasy Football Auction Tracker application. The core problem was to continue development from this codebase. Initially, the application was a sophisticated full-stack multi-team fantasy football league management system with an auction-style draft, user roles (Commissioner, Team), real-time budget calculations (including MAX BID), player database integration, and advanced UI.

The user's explicit requests and the resulting implemented features include:
1.  **Simplification to Single-User Commissioner Mode**: Remove all multi-user authentication (sign-in, sign-up, OAuth), team member logins, mobile support, and associated notifications. The app should open directly to the commissioner view.
2.  **Dual-Screen Setup**: Maintain  for the commissioner's laptop (Draft HQ) and  for a read-only TV screen (Auction Tracker), with all other routes redirecting to .
3.  **Core Drafting Functionality**: Preserve all existing features like nominating, bidding, assigning players, undo/redo, budget tracking, max bid calculations, roster spots, NFL player database, rankings, and league/team name management.
4.  **Dynamic Auction Values Restoration**: Re-implement the sophisticated auction value calculation system, ensuring specific position budget allocations (e.g., RB: 32%, WR: 38%, QB: 8%), realistic player distribution, and balanced multipliers. Also, fix player name font color for legibility.
5.  **Complete Kicker Elimination**: Remove Kickers entirely from all application functionality, including UI lists, search results, draft actions, auction value calculations, and league settings.
6.  **Default 3 Starting WRs**: Change the default league setting from 2 starting WRs to 3, adjusting budget allocations accordingly.
7.  **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensure the  screen automatically updates in real-time when picks are made or changes occur on the  screen.
8.  **CSV Export Feature**: Add functionality to export draft results (fantasy team name, all 16 drafted players) in CSV or Excel format from the Draft HQ.
9.  **Budget Synchronization & Display Stability**: Resolve the issue where  showed an incorrect default budget (50 instead of 00) and fix the Loading Auction Tracker flickering on the  screen.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI application handling all backend logic, including API endpoints for league management, player search, drafting, and MongoDB interactions. It loads player data from a CSV.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially, replaced with a comprehensive version to restore the full application.
        -   Modified to filter out Kickers from player search results and to update demo league creation for 3 WRs and no Kickers.
        -   Adjusted position requirements and budget allocations to reflect the 3 WR / no Kicker format.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated during the initial restoration phase to install the correct backend dependencies for the comprehensive application.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that encapsulates the entire frontend application. It manages state, defines routes ( and ), handles user interactions, makes API calls to the backend, and renders all UI components. It contains the logic for dynamic auction values, player search, drafting, league settings, and CSV export.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Completely rewritten during the initial restoration to incorporate the full application's logic.
        -   Extensively modified to remove multi-user authentication, implement the  (Draft HQ) and  (Auction Tracker) routing.
        -   Fixed issues related to the  route redirection and  button enablement.
        -   Implemented dynamic auction value calculations and fixed player name font color.
        -   Integrated comprehensive Kicker removal logic (UI filtering, budget adjustments, draft blocking).
        -   Updated default WR count to 3 and adjusted associated budget logic.
        -   Enhanced  and  for clarity and detail.
        -   Implemented real-time polling logic for synchronization between  and  using  and  for  persistence.
        -   Added CSV export functionality (functions , , and associated UI elements).
        -   Refined polling and state management in  to fix flickering and ensure consistent budget data by using a separate  state and  with smart change detection.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global CSS styles for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to ensure player names are clearly visible against the dark background.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced during the initial restoration to align with the dependencies of the comprehensive frontend application.

<current_work>
The Fantasy Football Auction Tracker application is currently fully functional as a single-user commissioner tool, designed for a dual-screen setup.

On the  route (dubbed Draft HQ), the commissioner has full control:
-   Access to player rankings with dynamically calculated auction values (e.g., Ja'Marr Chase 3, Josh Allen 0).
-   A Draft Player section allowing player search, team selection, bid entry, and pick finalization.
-   A Recent Picks section with undo functionality.
-   Quick Stats displaying total picks and open roster spots.
-   A Settings dialog to manage league configurations, now correctly showing WR: 3 as default and completely omitting any Kicker options.
-   Export Draft Results functionality via CSV, allowing export of all picks or team rosters for easy transfer to league hosting sites.

On the  route (labeled Auction Tracker), designed for an extended monitor/HDMI display, a read-only live draft board is presented:
-   It displays a Live Draft Board with comprehensive team cards for all 14 teams.
-   Each team card shows detailed budget information: MAX BID (85), Spent/Remaining budget, Avg/Spot, and budget utilization.
-   Roster spots tracking (16 left for each team) and positional needs (QB, RB, WR x3, TE, FLEX, DEF) are accurately displayed.
-   Recent picks for individual teams are shown.
-   The display now auto-refreshes every 5 seconds, pulling updated draft data from the backend without flickering, thanks to improved polling and state management.

Multi-user authentication, team member logins, mobile support, and notification systems have been completely removed, streamlining the application for a commissioner-centric workflow. The backend correctly filters out Kickers from all data, and the auction value system accurately rebalances budgets for the new 3 WR, no-Kicker format. The application is stable and ready for deployment in a proper environment.
